# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
This project was created to gather information on employees soon to be eligible for retirement, as well as for employees that can be candidates to serve as mentors for new onboards.

## Results
It was found that many employees across different departments are eligible for retirement soon:
Senior Engineers: 34%
Senior Staff: 34%
Engineer: 46%
Staff: 48%
Technical Lead: 37%
Assistant Engineer: 49%
Manager: 22%

It was also shown that there will be more employees retiring than those that can become mentors to new staff

## Summary 
There will be many positions that will need to be filled once the retirees leave their own positions. However, this also means that there will be many potential mentors available to help mentorship-eligible staff to fit into that role.
